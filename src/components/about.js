      <div class="about-me">
        &emsp;I am a senior computer science student studying at McGill
        University. I enjoy designing and developing webpages and web
        applications to create a dynamic user experience. With a passion for UI
        effects and animation, I am always learning new technologies. At the
        moment, I am spending some time with three.js and gsap.
        <br />
        <br />
        &emsp;More on the personal side, I'm motivated, self-disciplined and
        organized. And I always like a good challenge. I currently reside in
        Montreal, but I'm open to relocating anywhere within Canada. When I'm
        not working or coding, I enjoy French cinema, 20th century American
        literature, and going on long, aimless walks around the city.

        &emsp;If you want to know more about me, you can keep scrolling to find
        out what technologies I know, my projects, and some of my writings.
