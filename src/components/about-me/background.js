      &emsp;I graduated with a degree in computer science from{" "}
      <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> in 2022. Beyond
      academics, I was VP Marketing at Trek for Teens, a Tutor for CSUS

      &emsp; When it comes to coding, I enjoy designing and developing web
      applications to create a dynamic user experience. With a passion for UI
      effects and animation, I am always exploring technologies like three.js,
      WebGL, and GSAP.
